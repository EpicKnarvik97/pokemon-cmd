# pokemon-cmd
A commandline pokemon clone written in java.
This started as an assignment in computer science, but since it became quite advanced in just one week, I want to see where it might go.

This project has no clear goal, except mimicking the original pokemon game in a commandline interface. It would be interestig if people used this project as a base for custom games. There is still a lot to implement, but if it reaches a near complete stage, it should be possible to create custom types, moves pokemon, trainers, gyms, badges and maps.
